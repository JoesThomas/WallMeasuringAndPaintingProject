This application can only be run in command line in its current version.
If the user inputs the information requested by the application then the correct data will be output.
The application has a hardcoded value of 4 walls that the room contains, 
this is something that had I spent more time on this project I would have made more dynamic and fluid.
I would have also added a ui which I would have done using javafx.
I would have added more tests but got stuck upon the inability to type strings into the command line when using junit to test.
